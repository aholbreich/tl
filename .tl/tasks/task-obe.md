## Description

Add a --compact flag to 'tl agents' that emits a condensed ~12-15 line version of the agent workflow guide instead of the full ~70 line snippet.

Use case: agents with tight context windows (Claude Code long sessions, appended to system prompts, Copilot instructions) don't need the full 6-step narrative — they just need the command reference and key rules.

Behavior:
- 'tl agents --compact' prints a condensed snippet to stdout (does NOT write files).
- 'tl agents --write-files --compact' writes the compact version to agent instruction files instead of the full version. (Combined with --file to target specific files.)
- The compact format: bare commands with one-line explanations, no narrative paragraphs, no markdown headings. Example:

LEAD PROBLEM: The 'Why tl cli?' section leads with chat/TODO/Issues frustration — these are true but generic. The real hook is the agent coordination story, which is tl's differentiator from Beads/Backlog.md. Rewrite to lead with the agent coordination value prop, then layer on the broader benefits.\n\n2. EMPTY GAP: There's a stray '---' line between 'How tl cli compares' and 'Installation Options' — looks like a removed section that wasn't cleaned up.\n\n3. RPM OVERPROMINENCE: RPM/Fedora instructions are ~15 lines of repo config for a pre-launch tool. Move to a collapsible details/summary block or to a separate docs/install.md page. Keep brew + install script + source as the mainline flows.\n\n4. NO AGENTS ONBOARDING: After 'tl init', the next logical step is 'tl agents --write-files' to bootstrap agent instructions — but the README doesn't mention this. Add a 'Setup for agent collaboration' subsection after Quickstart or Installation.\n\n5. NO ONE-LINER FLOW: The ideal onboarding sequence 'brew install tl \u0026\u0026 tl init \u0026\u0026 tl agents --write-files' isn't surfaced anywhere. Add a 'Quick start' box right after the badge bar.\n\n6. MISSING TL AGENTS IN COMMAND TABLE: The 'Commands' section lists 'tl agents' but doesn't show --write-files or other flags. Add the flags inline.\n\n7. COMPARISON SECTION BURIED: The comparison to Beads/Backlog.md is deep in the page. Consider moving the comparison table earlier, or link to it more prominently from the lead section.\n\nImplementation plan:\n- Restructure sections to: (1) Hero + badges + demo, (2) Why tl? (lead with agent coordination), (3) Quickstart (with init + agents one-liner), (4) Installation Options (brew first, RPM collapsed), (5) Commands, (6) How it compares, (7) Development, (8) Further reading\n- Add 'tl completion --install' alongside 'tl init' in Quickstart\n- Ensure all tl agents flag changes from task-xb3 (--write-files rename) are reflected"

- The compact snippet should be embedded as a separate constant (agentsSnippetCompact) in cmd/agents.go alongside the existing agentsSnippet.
- The mergeAgentsBlock() function needs a param or variant for choosing compact vs full.
- Feature scenarios: --compact stdout, --compact + --write-files, --compact + --file targeting, verify compact content is shorter than full.

## Notes

- 2026-05-31T20:25:43Z [pi:agents-compact] note: Implemented tl agents --compact plus requested --file targeting. Added compact 12-line snippet, --compact flag for stdout and --write-files, repeatable --file support, expanded default agent instruction file list (AGENTS.md, CLAUDE.md, GEMINI_RULES.md, .cursorrules, .aider-rules.md, .github/copilot-instructions.md), BDD scenarios for compact/targeted/dry-run/nonexistent targets, docs updates. Validation: go test ./cmd ./bdd, make bdd, make test passed.
- 2026-05-31T20:27:35Z [pi:agents-compact] note: Follow-up from review: moved compact snippet text out of cmd/agents.go into embedded cmd/agents_snippet_compact.md, matching the existing full snippet file pattern. Validation: go test ./cmd ./bdd passed.
